# Iris Dataset - K-means Clustering

This project applies **K-means clustering** to the famous **Iris flower dataset** to group flowers into clusters based on their petal and sepal measurements.

---

## **Project Overview**
- The **Iris dataset** contains measurements of sepals and petals for three species of iris flowers.
- Using **unsupervised learning** (K-means), the project identifies natural groupings in the data without using the species labels.
- The results are visualized using an interactive scatter plot with Plotly.

## **Features**
-  K-means clustering with 3 clusters (matching the number of species).
-  Feature scaling using StandardScaler for better clustering performance.
-  Interactive visualization of clusters with Plotly Express.
-  Ability to explore clusters by hovering over points.
